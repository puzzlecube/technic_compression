Technic_compression is a mod that hopefully will become unneeded once these features are added to upstream technic_modpack. It adds recipes for the compressor like compressing cobblestone into compressed cobble (go figure, I know its meant to be a space saver but evidently some people like it as a building material) aswell as compressing desert and silver sand into desert and silver sandstone respectively like sand can. Aswhell as compressing dirrt into compressed dirt.

Depends: technic, moreblocks?, default? -- its got to have either moreblocks or default or it will do absolutely nothing.
